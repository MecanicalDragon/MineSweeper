# MineSweeper
My first application, developed with Swing in May of 2018

In this game you have to find and mark all mines on the minefield.
When you open the field sector with **left mouse button**, if there are some mines near it, you'll see a number there. 
This number determines how many mines you can find on adjacent fields. Mark the mines with a **right mouse button**.
**3rd mouse button** opens all adjacent non-marked fields.

**Blue counter** tracks your time. You should hurry if you want to place your name in the **Hall Of Fame**.<br/>
**Red counter** shows, how many mines still not marked on the minefield.<br/>
**Green counter** counts your left mouse clicks. Just for your notice.<br/>

You can pick difficulty within 3 modes or specify your own minefield parameters.<br/>
Also, you can take a look on TOP-results in the **Hall Of Fame** 
(special reward if you can remember all those people and where are they taken from)<br/>

With every successfull minefield cleaning your rank will be increased, yet it will be nullified after closing the game.<br/>
If you outperform someone if the Hall Of Fame, TOP-results will be updated.<br/>
Game saves TOP-results after closing the game.<br/>

Also, you can download .jar package [here](https://yadi.sk/d/WnMh3zPNriDL6w). Double-click for launching, JRE8 required.
